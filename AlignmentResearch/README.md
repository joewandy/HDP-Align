Alignment Research Codes
==================

Pipeline for comparing several feature-based alignment algorithms. Also for developing my own.

Included alignment algorithms so far:
* MZMine 2 (Join & Ransac) http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/
* SIMA http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/02/03/bioinformatics.btr051
* SMFM http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23665772
* A few others of my own creation ...

Data can be loaded from the benchmark data provided in Lange, et al. (2008) (http://msbi.ipb-halle.de/msbi/caap). 
Alternatively, we can also load data from a simple built-in LC-MS metabolomics simulator. 
We also include built-in support for simulated proteomics data from MSSimulator (http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr200155f)

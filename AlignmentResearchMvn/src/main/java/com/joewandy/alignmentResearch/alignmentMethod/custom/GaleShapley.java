/**
 * This class implements the Gale-Shapley algorithm for stable marriages.  It
 * requires that cost functions be defined over the sets of both "suitors" and
 * "reviewer".
 *
 * Note that the algorithm is not symmetric in its optimality: as implemented,
 * it is optimal for the "suitors", but the stable, suitor-optimal solution
 * may or may not be optimal for the "reviewers".
 *
 * This algorithm should be <i>reasonably</i> efficient, but is not optimized.

MZmine 2 (modified)
==================

Custom-hacked version of MZmine 2.10 for research and experimenting purposes.

Modified so far:
* Added a new module CSVCorrExportModule for exporting the correlation matrix of peaks in a peaklist.
* Hacked custom identification module to compute 'votes' assigned to peak identity, and also to accept noise source of database for identification.
* Any others .. ?
